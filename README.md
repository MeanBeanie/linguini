# linguini

Inspired by tsoding's olive-c, this is a simple graphics/rendering system

The name comes from the Pixar character from Ratatouille, since the abbrievation for PixelArray is Pixarr, also I was hungry

# Build Flags

Now requires: Freetype2

Run these with `make` to add support for various things

`USE_SDL=1` for SDL2 support

`USE_X11=1` for X11/Xlib support

`USE_WAYLAND=1` for basic(very bad) wayland support

Do note i tried to make wayland work out, and it shows a window n all, but wayland is hella complicated
